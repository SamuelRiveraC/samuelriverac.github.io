    	    	<p>I started my journey installing mods on my videogames and tweaking them on Notepad. At college I went to a coding course, where I discovered my passion for creating solutions to problems through code. I graduated in Computer Systems engineering specialized in web applications. As I mostly worked freelance and remotely I had to learn how to manage my own time and projects, learn about digital marketing, branding, sales, and customer service, which apply daily as a Developer creating efficient, good looking Interfaces and with high usability for users.</p>
