excerpt: "Wordpress development and design for the UNMF site"

description: "<p> The UNM Foundation wanted to fix some remaining issues on their sites after the site was developed, those issues were regarding a better and more accurate way to log the daily donations made to their site through Authorize.net and get a daily email report of a consolidated spreadsheet of different donation forms made with Gravity forms, across the website </p> <p> The site is a Bedrock developed website, with totally custom theme. Which I took my time to modify it according the requirements specified. For the consolidated spreadsheet i just created a simple plugin with a cronjob to compile all the info required and send a nice and perfect for their internal process CSV spreadsheet</p><p> Currently we are working at developing a new theme that retains all the functionalities but with a design optimized make easier the visitors to donate to their favourite funds, and dedicate them to persons special to them in a streamlined manner </p>"
