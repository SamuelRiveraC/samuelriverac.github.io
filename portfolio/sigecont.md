excerpt: "Full stack development for Contract management system"

description: "<p>The local branch of PDVSA chose to not remove their past contract management software so they needed to develop a new application that could handle contracts in an orderly and safe manner, only accessible for their Intranet. They also as a big national company, have a compilation of standards and rules on how to develop their software.</p> <p>As an Intern, I had to go with my superior to the administrative office to listen to their needs and compile them into User stories. Once we had planned what to do I designed the app according to the company’s rules and standards and leaving me with a custom Codeigniter (PHP) framework and the PostgreSQL database, I was left in my own devices to develop the modules necessary to fulfill all the user stories.</p> <p>I finished the project when my internship was due to finish. My superiors uploaded the server to test it and check how well it worked with the members of the administration office, they were happy with the results, they improved it on top of what I developed, and today there are plans to use the app on most of PDVSA regional administrative offices. For me, this was a great experience, since it was my first project and got a success that motivated me to replicate on my next projects.</p>"
