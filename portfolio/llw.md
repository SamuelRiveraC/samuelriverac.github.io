excerpt: "Wordpress Web development for a migration to London blog"

description: "<p>My client needed to integrate the APIs of their business partners, EURooms and EasyRoomLet, to provide in his website the residences available, It wasn’t as easy as just calling the API points and called it a day, because he needed to storage the rooms on his database for adding custom content, internal notes and statistics. Besides that, he wanted to revamp his site install a new theme to upgrade the business image, and add new ways to monetize the site like the London job search tool. </p><p> Both APIs while easy to get into, had radically different schemas and content, I created a cronjob and one by one filter and format the info of the APIs and integrate it with the website, after I finished the cronjob recognized which properties were already saved and restored them, recognized the images from each property and uploaded them if there were more, maintaining the data on our end as well. </p><p> Although Brexit took a toll on the business, the blog had modest growth, around 10% in a matter of weeks, and reduced the average page loading speed by 50% (9s to 4.5s).</p>
