excerpt: "Full stack developer for a tech demostrator web app"

description: "<p>My client wanted to create a mobile app demo, similar to what Zelle is in us but for the European market (particularly Nederlands and Germany) harnessing the opportunities that PSD2 and Open Banking European directives created, the demo required to connect the Deutschebank, Rabobank, and Neonomics API to be technically successful.</p> <p>I investigated the APIs and directives to make a Gantt chart of the time the development would take. I designed the app in Figma focusing on making a simple and smooth interface and flow to have a good user experience. After my Client approved it, I went on to develop the app with React as a front-end and Typescript AdonisJs as a back-end. Integrate the APIs with all the necessary security using oauth2 authentification and added the respective data to our database to have everything in check.</p> <p>This is a recent job 🙂 Once I get news about it I will let you know and update this portfolio page</p>"
