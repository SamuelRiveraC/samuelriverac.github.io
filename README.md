# Welcome to my Portfolio Repository

I have developed 4 portfolio sites in the course of 3 years, the first one was made on Laravel, the second one was made on Wordpress, and the last 2 had been made with Gatsby, Easier and cheaper to host, I only need to code and push into the repository and that's it :)

## 🧐 What's inside?

It's very simple, it has 4 pages (Home, About, Contact and Portfolio), different components i often reuse on the pages and a portfolio CRUD powered by Netlify CMS

The style is fully responsive and takes in account accessibility needs and color blindness filters

## To do List

- Add more examples of work, Add youtube videos for each one be

- Update: Refactor to styled components

- An even better 404 page

- A fun easter egg
